For the Maven Halloween Challenge, youâ€™ll need to take a data-driven approach for becoming the most popular trick-or-treating house on the block.

Using online votes ranking 85 types of candy, your task is to find the 3 treats you'll give out on Halloween to guarantee that trick-or-treaters of all tastes find something they'll love and present the data to back up your decision.
